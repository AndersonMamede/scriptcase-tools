		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p>
			If you often use ScriptCase to develop your applications, you've probably
			noticed that its development environment lacks some basic functionalities
			(e.g., no shortcut keys, not restoring last cursor position), while others
			could be improved (e.g., code editor, main menu sensitivity).<br><br>
			Even though some users have pointed out some of the problems on ScriptCase
			official forum, those improvements haven't been made yet.<br><br>
			This Chrome extension was created to fulfill these gaps.
		</p>
		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		<p>
			Because ScriptCase doesn't provide a public API, hacking into its
			JavaScript/HTML/CSS code was the (only) way to go. And because of
			that, this extension heavily depends on ScriptCase's code and
			structure (e.g., specifics JavaScript functions, the DOM structure,
			some elements with specific ID/class name).
		</p>
		<h2>ScriptCase Support</h2>
		<p>
			* ScriptCase v7<br>
			* ScriptCase v8<br><br>
			Other ScriptCase versions might work correctly, but were not tested.<br><br>
